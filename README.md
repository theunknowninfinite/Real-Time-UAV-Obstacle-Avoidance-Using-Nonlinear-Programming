# Real-Time UAV Obstacle Avoidance Using NonLinear Programming
This project showcases real-time obstacle avoidance in UAVs by utilizing the ModalAI Voxl 2 Sentinel Drone with the PX4 flight stack and an Intel Realsense D435i camera to precisely detect obstacles in its environment. The detected object positions are incorporated as constraints in a non-linear programming-based path planning algorithm, allowing the UAV to autonomously generate safe flight paths with a defined distance threshold around these obstacles. To ensure continuous paths, reference velocities and accelerations are calculated at each waypoint. By accounting for room dimensions and drone dynamics as constraints in the optimizer, these paths ensure efficient and secure navigation, enabling the drone to reach its designated destination accurately and reliably.
